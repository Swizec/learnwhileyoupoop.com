# MobX & Redux side by side

What could be more fun than implementing the same app in both MobX and Redux?

Recording without a mic. ðŸ™ˆ

Watch the sped up video to see how quick it was to implement the same YouTube player using MobX. The main benefit is that our entire state management fits in a single file.

```javascript
class Store {
  @observable index = 0
  @observable playing = false
  @observable
  videoList = [
    'https://youtu.be/JnMXuWy2t8A',
    'https://youtu.be/MuAhztaKmZ4',
    'https://youtu.be/YoGTu2GkNbc',
  ]

  @computed
  get videoUrl() {
    const N = this.videoList.length,
      i = this.index

    return i >= 0 ? this.videoList[i % N] : this.videoList[N + i % N]
  }

  @action goNext = () => (this.index += 1)
  @action goBack = () => (this.index -= 1)
  @action play = () => (this.playing = true)
  @action pause = () => (this.playing = false)
}
```

Same state and actions as [the Redux version](), a computed value for the `videoUrl` and that's it. Whole thing fits in 23 lines of readable code.

Compared to the 65 lines it took for Redux ðŸ¤”
