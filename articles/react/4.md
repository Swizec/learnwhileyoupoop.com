We talked about functional react components, but there's another way. You can make them using classes. Class-based react components are a lot like functional components in that they render some JSX, but they have a few special powers. They can have state, lifecycle hooks, and pretty much anything that the JavaScript class can have.

Now, class-based components do have a little bit more overhead, so I recommend using functional components if you can get away with.

Let's change our message component into a class. We write class message extends react.component. This is how all class-based components are defined. Then we take what used to be our functional component and rename that into a render function. That render function returns what we used to return from our functional component.

Every class-based component needs to have at least a render method. We have to also take message out of our props, which are now this.props instead of directly in the argument.

I mentioned that class-based components also have state. We define state. This is like a magical property, which we're going to talk about tomorrow. Let's say we want to keep in state whether this message was already read or not. We say already read is false by default. We're going to have a small paragraph on top, renders only if this.state.read is set to true. Otherwise, we don't render if we change the default state to true. That's how state works. We're going to talk more about state tomorrow and how we can change state and all of that.

Another cool thing in class-based components is that we have lifecycle hooks. We can use lifecycle hooks to do different things based on what react is doing with our component. We're going to talk more about that in a future video. Right now I just want to show you the basic idea.

We want to do something when our component is mounted. Console.log mounted a message. Mounting means that it's rendered into the doc, so when the page refreshes, two console.logs form mounted a ... Because this is a JavaScript class, we can basically do whatever we want with it. Some random property, we can access that property from wherever. Close the log out and it prints out.

These properties aren't as useful as the magic state property, but they can come in handy for various things. In a nutshell, this is what class-based react components look like.

There you go. Two types of components. Functional components are light and breezy, and class-based components give you more power with state, lifecycle hooks, and the other class stuff, but they also have more overhead. Use them responsibly.
